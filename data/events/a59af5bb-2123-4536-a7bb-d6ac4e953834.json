  "description": "Choreographed by Christian Spuck with music by Hans Zender, this ballet uses Franz Schubert's 24-song cycle Winterreise as its foundation, transforming the Romantic lied into large ensemble scenes and intimate solos. The piece explores themes of isolation, longing, and existential wandering through contemporary dance, merging classical composition with bold physical storytelling.",
