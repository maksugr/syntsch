  "description": "A rare deep listening experience featuring polyrhythmic jazz programming at Berghain's Kantine. The event offers an alternative to the club's typical techno fare, focusing on improvisation, extended form, and experimental jazz traditions. This is a space for careful attention and sonic exploration rather than dancefloor abandon, bringing together musicians working at the intersections of free jazz, contemporary composition, and improvised music within one of Berlin's most iconic venues.",
