OFF SCORE', running until 3 May 2026, Hamburger Bahnhof presents a programme providing an overview of Kahrs' performances from the past 16 years. Kahrs' performances question musical structures as well as factors of music production, performance practice, and listening habits, challenging virtuosity and traditional formats. The exhibition shows the most extensive selection of her works at the intersection of art and music to date.",
