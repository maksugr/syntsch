  "description": "German artist Reiner Maria Matysik presents a solo exhibition addressing post-human futures through sculptural installations resembling an anatomical museum. The work features forms evoking biological matter, mycelium, and sexual organs, offering an abstracted meditation on life after humanity. Matysik's speculative biology explores evolutionary possibilities beyond human extinction, questioning what forms life might take in Earth's deep future.",
