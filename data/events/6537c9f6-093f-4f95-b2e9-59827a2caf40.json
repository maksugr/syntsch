  "description": "Iranian vocalist Mahsa Vahdat performs at Passionskirche. Vahdat is one of Iran's most important musical voices in exile, forbidden to perform solo in her homeland since the 1979 revolution. Her work fuses Persian classical traditions with contemporary experimental music, and her concerts carry profound political weight—she sings of women's freedom, exile, and resistance. The church setting adds another layer: sacred space transformed into a site of dissent and beauty.",
