  "description": "Now in its 10th edition, KAPUTX is a celebration of Filipino queer rave culture that resonates with the punk spirit of rebellion. The festival brings together artists and DJs from Berlin, Paris, and beyond, creating a vital space for queer Asian diasporic voices in Europe's club culture landscape. KAPUTX represents an important intersection of subcultural resistance, queer identity, and postcolonial perspectives within Berlin's electronic music scene. The two-week programming offers a counternarrative to mainstream club culture, centering marginalized communities while delivering cutting-edge sonic experiences.",
