  "description": "The 11th edition of Berlin's renowned biennial photography festival explores contemporary visual art under the motto 'what stands between us.' With over 100 exhibitions, artist talks, and workshops across the city, the festival addresses polarization, nationalism, and community rupture through the lens of photography. This citywide program questions how images can help us understand deepening rifts in society and points of connection.",
