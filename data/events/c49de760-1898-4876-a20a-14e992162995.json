  "description": "Against the backdrop of violence in Iran and the longstanding ban on female voices, Faravaz Farvardin and MADANII create a zone of poetic resistance where attentive listening becomes political act. Together with music journalist Aida Baghernejad, they employ music, sound, and voice as tools to express intimacy, resistance, and solidarity. The evening transforms the banned female voice into an instrument of defiance and memory, centering sonic practice as cultural survival.",
