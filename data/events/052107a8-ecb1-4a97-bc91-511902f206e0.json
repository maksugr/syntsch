  "description": "Think you know musical theatre? This Neukölln festival flips the script completely, bringing performers from across the globe to experiment with beats, drag, and pop-infused spectacle. Case in point: performer Meik van Severen aka The Faye Fatale treads the boards belting out classics from Claudio Monteverdi to Freddie Mercury. The festival challenges conventions of what musical theater can be, blending high and low culture in ways that speak to Berlin's experimental performance tradition. It's anything but traditional — a genuine collision of opera, pop, and contemporary performance art.",
