  "description": "Club culture and electronic music have long been seen as spaces of collective resistance, community, and celebration. EastUnBloc creates a place of empowerment and resistance with Ljubljana artist Marina Gržinić and features Bass Resistance, a Berlin-based Ukrainian DJ collective formed in opposition to war and oppression. This isn't just a party — it's a politically engaged event that asks urgent questions about how nightlife can function as a space of solidarity and survival. The cultural weight here is undeniable: dance music as activism, the dancefloor as a site of resistance.",
