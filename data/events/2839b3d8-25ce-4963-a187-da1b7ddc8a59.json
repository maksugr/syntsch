  "description": "Against the backdrop of Berlin's club closures, Strom Festival brings electronic music and club culture into the Philharmonie, creating an unprecedented encounter between highbrow concert halls and underground dance floors. The festival features Berghain residents and techno icons like Ellen Allien performing in both the großer Saal and the foyer, dissolving boundaries between white cube and black box, museum and theater, establishing a rare conversation across disciplines in a city defined by moving images.",
