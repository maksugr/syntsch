  "description": "Flyleaf is Europe's leading celebration of small press, independent publishing, and zine culture. Held simultaneously across three intimate Neukölln spaces—Apartment, Falschrum, and WIRWIR—the festival brings together 90 international publishers, book artists, and zinesters. Expect poetry walks, workshops, readings, performances, and firesides. It's about analog creativity, civic magic, and the politics of DIY publishing. A must for anyone invested in the future of print culture, grassroots distribution, and bibliodiversity beyond corporate gatekeeping.",
