  "description": "Galerie Thomas Schulte presents an extensive solo exhibition of works on paper, rubbings, and objects by Matt Mullican. Familiar systems of organizing and representing information coalesce with idiosyncratic ones at the core of Mullican's practice. His use of primary colors and basic forms, particularly the circle or sphere, comes to the fore as initial legibility gives way to underlying complexity. Mullican has been developing his cosmology and system of signs and symbols since the '70s, with early works alongside recent rubbings highlighting continuities and the elaboration of a reality structured across multiple levels.",
