  "description": "Chetna Vora's ethnographic portrait of East German women living in Berlin in the early 1980s, a film which was almost destroyed. Her ability to capture the quiet resilience and everyday lives of East German women offers a rare glimpse into a world rarely seen through such a nuanced and foreign perspective, introduced by curator Rastko Novakovic.",
