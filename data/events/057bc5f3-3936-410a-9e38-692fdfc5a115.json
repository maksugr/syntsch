  "description": "Canadian post-rock legends Godspeed You! Black Emperor return for a deeply immersive live performance. Known for their cinematic, apocalyptic soundscapes, GY!BE build towering crescendos with strings, tape loops, and guitar feedback. Their music is slow, patient, and political—a communal ritual for deep listening purists. No stage banter, no showmanship, just the raw power of instrumental storytelling. Essential for anyone interested in the radical edges of experimental rock and sound as resistance.",
