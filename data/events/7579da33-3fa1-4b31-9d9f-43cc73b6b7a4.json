  "description": "Black Midi's enigmatic frontman Geordie Greep brings his São Paulo-recorded solo debut 'The New Sound' to Berlin, colliding Latin jazz-rock, prog, and tropicália with his signature surrealist lyricism. Expect intellectual provocation, genre chaos, and fearless performance. Support from Corte! adds further intensity. This is not easy listening—it's confrontational, ambitious, and exhilarating. For those who want music that makes demands and rewards close attention.",
