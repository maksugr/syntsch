  "description": "The 23rd Silent Film Concert Festival invites audiences to experience masterpieces of early cinema accompanied by new live film music and extraordinary artistic interpretations. The festival reimagines silent-era classics through contemporary composition and performance, bridging historical cinema with experimental sound practices. This is not nostalgia—it's an active reconsideration of what film music can be when freed from synchronized sound, allowing improvisation, reinterpretation, and radical scoring.",
