  "description": "Swedish artist Klara Lidén presents a major exhibition across three floors of KW, exploring themes of urban unbuilding and spatial intervention. Known for her physical engagement with urban structures, Lidén's work addresses questions of dwelling, displacement, and the body's relationship to architecture. This substantial solo show features video installations, sculptural interventions, and documentation of performances that investigate the residues of contemporary urban life and moments of material transformation.",
