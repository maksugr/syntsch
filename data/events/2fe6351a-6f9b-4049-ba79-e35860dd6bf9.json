  "description": "A 400th anniversary tribute to John Dowland, one of the most important European musicians of the late Renaissance and early Baroque. Harpist Luise Enzian and mezzo-soprano Tehila Nini Goldstein present an intimate late-night concert featuring vocal and instrumental works by Dowland and composers who influenced him. The program explores the celebrated melancholic quality of this music in a contemplative late-night setting. This is a culturally significant deep dive into early music, offering historical resonance and emotional depth beyond typical concert fare.",
