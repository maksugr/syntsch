  "description": "The annual dance protest held every Valentine's Day at Brandenburg Gate stems from a stark statistic: one in three women worldwide will experience violence. This global movement uses dance as a form of resistance and solidarity, bringing communities together to demand an end to violence against women and girls. A collective action combining performance, activism, and public gathering.",
