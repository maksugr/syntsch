  "description": "Kurdish folk singer Sivan Perwer performs at Haus der Kulturen der Welt. Perwer is the son of legendary Kurdish musician Şivan Perwer, and continues his father's legacy of using music as a form of cultural preservation and political expression. His concert at HKW—a venue known for hosting critical discourses on postcolonial futures—positions Kurdish music within global conversations about diaspora, displacement, and identity.",
