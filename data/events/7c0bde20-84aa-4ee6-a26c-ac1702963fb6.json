  "description": "Berlin's premier culinary festival transforms the capital into a gastronomic playground where top chefs, winemakers, and food enthusiasts celebrate outstanding cuisine in special locations across the city. Far from typical, eat! Berlin is a carefully curated series of events bringing together top chefs from Berlin, Germany, and beyond at unique and exclusive venues. New in 2026: SparklingB!, Berlin's first major sparkling wine fair at the AXICA Congress Center at Brandenburg Gate, where national and international producers present champagne, crémant, cava, Franciacorta, and PetNat. This is a testament to Berlin's evolving food culture—from vegan capital of the world to haute cuisine destination.",
