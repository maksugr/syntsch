Known for her genre-defying approach that blends folk, electronica, and avant-garde sensibilities, Molina has built a cult following over decades. Her loop-based compositions and distinctive vocal style create immersive soundscapes that challenge conventional song structures. This rare Berlin appearance offers a chance to experience one of South America's most innovative musical voices in an intimate setting.",
