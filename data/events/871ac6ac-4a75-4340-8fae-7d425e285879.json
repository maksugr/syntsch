  "description": "Florian Pelka's colorful images exist at the intersection of abstraction and figuration, combining elements from the plant and animal world, mythology, and iconography into multi-layered visual worlds. The exhibition Syntagma—referring to the composition of fragments—makes the artist's visual language tangible as an open, ambiguous system. Pelka's work offers a contemporary take on collage aesthetics, inviting viewers to decode the relationships between disparate elements. An artist talk with Pelka takes place on March 14 at 4pm.",
