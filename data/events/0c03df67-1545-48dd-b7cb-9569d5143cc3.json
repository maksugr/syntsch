  "description": "An extraordinary evening where dance meets spoken word. Performers from the dance scene join forces with poetry slammers on the main stage. In several rounds, they compete solo, against each other, and in dance-poetry duos, captivating both the audience and jury. The entire event is accompanied by the beats of renowned Berlin beatboxer Mando, with the audience jury deciding the winner. This is a groundbreaking fusion exploring how movement and language can push each other out of their comfort zones, followed by an after-party with DJ Achraf.",
