  "description": "A major event by and for the dance community. Dance decisively shapes Berlin's cultural life and is a driving force for change on and off the stage—in how and where we move, in art, and in society. Dance creates utopias, demands participation, and writes histories. Actors from the field of dance and its surroundings discuss the impact and potential of dance, considering visions for and concrete needs of dance in Berlin and beyond—and how to realize them. Includes statements, choreographic interventions, and a panel discussion with Joe Chialo, Berlin Senator for Culture and Social Cohesion. In cooperation with Tanzbüro Berlin and Zeitgenössischer Tanz Berlin e.V.",
