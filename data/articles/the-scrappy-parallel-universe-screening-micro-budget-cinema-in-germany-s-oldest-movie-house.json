  "lead": "While the Berlinale fills its gleaming halls a few streets away, BIFF is doing something rougher and more honest — screening films that cost less than a mid-range car inside Germany's oldest cinema, a Kreuzberg relic that nearly closed its doors for good and now hosts the kind of work the industry barely knows exists.",
  "body": "The oldest cinema in Germany sits on Kottbusser Damm in Kreuzberg, a street that has weathered gentrification debates, rent wars, and over a century of Berlin turning itself inside out. Moviemento Kino opened in 1907, reportedly as the Vitascope Theatre, a 375-seat picture house. Today it holds three screens, the largest seating barely over a hundred. Its bathrooms, visitors report with a mixture of horror and affection, appear to date from roughly the same era as the building itself. For one week in February, this is where a certain strain of independent cinema stakes its claim. Not in the gleaming halls of the Berlinale. A few streets away, in a venue that still feels like something you'd stumble into by accident.\n\nThe Berlin Independent Film Festival, now in its sixteenth edition, runs from 6 to 8 February 2026 (with the wider programme stretching through the month), overlapping deliberately with the Berlinale and the European Film Market. The timing is strategic and a little cheeky. While the EFM fills the Gropius Bau and Martin-Gropius complex with acquisition executives, sales agents, and name-brand auteurs, BIFF positions itself as the scrappy parallel universe where micro-budget filmmakers can screen their work, network, and try to get a foothold in an industry that barely acknowledges their existence. The festival has no formal connection to the Berlinale. It simply feeds off the same gravitational pull, drawing filmmakers and industry figures who are already in Berlin for those ten days in February.\n\nBIFF's organising principle is blunt: low-budget filmmaking deserves serious attention. But it also reveals a tension the festival hasn't fully resolved. Award categories include Best Micro-budget Feature (under €100,000), Best No-Budget Feature (under €10,000), and a Low-Budget tier pegged below €25,000. These reflect the actual economics of a vast swath of global filmmaking that rarely registers at festivals fixated on premieres and star power. The no-budget tier, in particular, represents something closer to punk than to commerce; films made for under €10,000 exist in defiance of industrial logic. Yet BIFF also name-drops Claire Denis and Tilda Swinton (past participants, the promotional materials say, without elaborating). Denis and Swinton are both figures with deep roots in arthouse cinema, and their proximity lends BIFF credibility. It would be more honest, and more interesting, to centre the films that actually screen here.\n\nThis year's programme is dense. The official selections include Weekend Cowboy by Mads Erichsen, Koza by Leyla Giraud, CoronaFAUST by Nicole Felden, Libre – A Celebration of the Queer Body by Arthur Lopes, and Kamakiri by Masato Riesser. Last Apartment in Berlin by Markus Bräutigam sounds almost too on the nose for a Kreuzberg screening. Sick World by Stefan Roloff and Not Uniquely Incompetent by Maclaine Black carry titles that suggest filmmakers who have been paying attention to the news. Previous editions have awarded films like Precarious by Weston Terray (Audience Award for Best Feature) and Any Given Day by Margaret Byrne (Best Documentary Feature), work that circulates in the gap between festival exposure and streaming libraries. Double Threat, produced by BIFF board member Kurt Patino, managed to land in Amazon Prime's US top ten alongside studio blockbusters. That says something about the aspiration here: visibility over prestige.\n\nThe festival's leadership reflects the same orientation. Anna Maybury, who became BIFF's president at the end of 2024, is an Australian film producer based in Los Angeles whose background stretches from dance to on-camera hosting for music and entertainment channels, with credits alongside Sony, Universal Music, and Live Nation. Katie Amanda Keane, another board figure, has a career built across American network television; she's appeared in How I Met Your Mother, NCIS, Agents of SHIELD, and the Blumhouse horror film The Manor. Festival Director Erich Schultz rounds out the core team with Natasha Marburger as Festival Manager. These are people embedded in the mid-level machinery of Hollywood and independent production. Their instincts run toward industry pragmatism: how do you actually get a film seen, sold, distributed? BIFF's daily skills-share workshops and evening networking events reflect that. Filmmakers trade EFM tips, share marketing strategies, help each other navigate the distance between finishing a film and getting anyone to watch it.\n\nThis pragmatism is both BIFF's strength and its limitation. The festival doesn't pretend to be curating the next wave of radical cinema. It functions more like a trade fair with screenings attached, a place where a first-time director from Scandinavia or a queer filmmaker from Brazil can show their work to an audience that includes buyers, managers, and fellow directors who understand what it means to make something out of almost nothing. The emphasis on first- and second-time directors is genuine and, in the current climate, necessary. With mid-budget independent film in a state of near-collapse across Europe and North America, festivals that serve the entry level of the pipeline aren't just nice to have. They're structural.\n\nMoviemento itself matters here in ways that go beyond symbolism. In late 2019, the cinema's premises were put up for sale by real estate agents, and after more than 112 years of continuous operation, the venue faced closure. A public campaign, the Moviemento Saver initiative, drew support from filmmakers, politicians, and audiences worldwide. The cinema survived. It now occupies a kind of second life: preserved but never quite secure. That makes it a fitting host for films made under similar conditions. Screening a no-budget feature in one of Moviemento's smaller rooms (67 or 62 seats) is an intimate experience. Close quarters, old walls, the musty warmth of a building that has been showing films since before the Weimar Republic. You're watching cinema in a space where people have been watching cinema for longer than almost anywhere else in the country.\n\nYear after year, the question BIFF has to answer is whether strategic proximity to the Berlinale translates into actual opportunity. The EFM is happening down the street. Industry professionals are flooding Berlin. But how many of them walk into Moviemento? How many acquisitions executives sit through a shorts block at 3:30 on a February afternoon? The honest answer is probably very few. BIFF's real value may lie less in deals than in the community it builds: filmmakers meeting other filmmakers, sharing what they know, forming networks that persist long after the screenings end. In an industry that runs on relationships, a week of structured proximity to other people doing the same difficult thing has genuine worth, even if it never produces a sale that makes the trades.\n\nWhat would sharpen the festival is a harder commitment to the thing that makes it unusual. The no-budget category could be BIFF's centre of gravity rather than one tier among several. The framing sometimes edges toward the aspirational language of startup culture (hustle, the marketplace of ideas) when the reality on screen is rawer and stranger than that. Owning the radical economics of sub-€10,000 filmmaking would give BIFF a more convincing reason to exist alongside the Berlinale, rather than simply in its orbit.\n\nFebruary in Berlin is grey and cold, and the city fills with people carrying lanyards and tote bags printed with distributor logos. Somewhere on Kottbusser Damm, in a building that has been showing films since the year the first purpose-built cinemas appeared in Germany, a few dozen people crowd into a room with bad heating and a screen not much bigger than a bedsheet. The films they're watching cost less than a mid-range car. Some of them are genuinely good. That's enough to keep the doors open.",
