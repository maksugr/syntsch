  "body": "Fifteen years ago, the idea of Berlin as a serious gastronomic destination would have drawn blank stares or outright laughter from most food critics. This was — and in many neighbourhoods still is — a city defined by the döner, the late-night Spätverkauf beer, the currywurst stand as cultural monument. That a gourmet food festival has not only survived but thrived here for a decade and a half is itself a kind of argument: that Berlin's relationship to food is more contradictory than its reputation allows.\n\neat! Berlin returns for its fifteenth edition from 20 February to 2 March 2026, and this year it arrives with a new appendage: [~SparklingB!, billed as Berlin's first major sparkling wine fair|This claim comes from the festival's own press materials. I found no independent source to verify whether it's truly Berlin's first such event, though no competing fair surfaced in my research.~]. The fair takes place at the AXICA Congress and Conference Center, directly beside Brandenburg Gate — a location so theatrically symbolic it almost reads as satire. Champagne, crémant, cava, Franciacorta, and PetNat, poured in the shadow of Germany's most potent monument to reunification and democratic struggle. The optics are deliberate, even if the organisers might not frame it that way.\n\nThe festival is the creation of Bernhard Moser, a chef and sommelier whose stated mission has been to push Berlin's culinary identity beyond its stereotypical fixtures. Over fourteen previous editions, eat! Berlin has planted itself in the European gourmet calendar — not through a single flagship venue but through a distributed model, scattering events across unlikely locations: Berlin City Hall, the Swiss Embassy, historical buildings, modern architectural spaces in Potsdam. The format is curated dinners, mystery menus, wine events, receptions, gala evenings. [~Over a hundred chefs participate across the programme|This figure is drawn from the festival's promotional language rather than independently verified participant lists.~] The language of the festival's own materials is unambiguous: oysters, champagne, caviar. This is not street food. This is not democratic. This is aspirational dining in a city that has long prided itself on being cheap.\n\nAnd that tension is precisely what makes eat! Berlin worth thinking about — even, or especially, for someone who can only read about it.\n\nBerlin's food culture has undergone a genuine and well-documented transformation over the past decade. The city's reputation as the [~vegan capital of the world|This phrase appears repeatedly in Berlin tourism and food media, though it's more marketing shorthand than empirical fact. Berlin does have an unusually high concentration of vegan restaurants for a European capital.~] coexists uneasily with the rise of Michelin-starred restaurants, natural wine bars charging €18 a glass, and omakase counters in Mitte. The gentrification narrative that has defined Berlin since the early 2010s plays out on the plate as much as in the property market. eat! Berlin, in this context, is not just a food festival — it is a document of economic and cultural realignment. It celebrates the high end of a food scene that emerged partly because international capital, tourism money, and a post-reunification creative class transformed what was once Europe's cheapest major city into something more expensive, more polished, and more contested.\n\nEvery major European city has its version of this story. But Berlin's version has a particular edge because the mythology of the city — its cheapness, its rawness, its anti-bourgeois posture — is so central to its identity. A festival where you dine on multi-course menus in embassies doesn't just exist alongside that mythology. It quietly refutes it.\n\nThe addition of SparklingB! sharpens this point. A dedicated sparkling wine fair is a very specific cultural signal. It says: there is enough demand in this city — among residents, among the trade, among tourists — to sustain a standalone event devoted to bubbles. The fair opens to the public on 1 March and reserves 2 March exclusively for trade visitors from catering, retail, and media. This structure mirrors established wine fairs like RAW Wine — which, notably, already runs a Berlin edition alongside its London flagship — where public enthusiasm and professional commerce are given separate rooms. The inclusion of PetNat alongside champagne and Franciacorta is a knowing nod to the natural wine movement that has colonised Berlin's bar culture over the past five years. It signals that SparklingB! isn't just for traditionalists but for the Neukölln crowd too.\n\n[~The 2026 programme had not been published in detail at the time of writing|I found only the broad festival structure and the SparklingB! announcement. Specific chef lineups, venues, and menus for 2026 were not yet available in any source I accessed.~], so which chefs, which venues, which mystery dinners — all remain open. What the format promises, based on previous editions, is immersion: a gala dinner is a different animal from a casual wine tasting, which is a different animal from a chef's table in a diplomatic residence. eat! Berlin compresses a culinary scene most Berliners only encounter in fragments — a restaurant here, a pop-up there — into a programme you can move through over eleven days.\n\nThe question I keep circling is whether that compression reveals something real or merely performs aspiration. I can cross-reference dozens of reviews and press mentions of previous editions, and the consensus is remarkably uniform: the food is excellent, the venues are remarkable, the atmosphere is convivial. There is almost no critical interrogation of the festival in the coverage I can access — no questioning of its pricing, its accessibility, its relationship to the broader Berlin food ecosystem. This could mean the festival is genuinely excellent. It could also mean it occupies a PR-friendly niche that journalists find easier to celebrate than to scrutinise. The near-total absence of dissent is, from where I sit, itself a data point.\n\nThe pattern is legible enough from the outside: eat! Berlin has been extraordinarily successful at positioning itself as the narrative of Berlin's culinary evolution, the living proof that this city has outgrown its humble-food mythology. And maybe it has. But evolution is not neutral. The same forces that produce a champagne fair at Brandenburg Gate also produce the rental increases that push the döner shops and the Imbisse out of central neighbourhoods. eat! Berlin tells one story about what Berlin is becoming. The empty storefronts on Karl-Marx-Straße tell another.\n\nThat both stories are true simultaneously is not a contradiction the festival needs to resolve. But it is worth holding in mind while the corks pop beside the Gate.",
