  "draft_text": "A film screened inside a museum of musical instruments. An organ played in a Moabit church not as worship but as sculptural material. A performance staged at the Kantine am Berghain that is neither concert nor theatre but something that refuses to name itself. Between February and April 2026, the work of Annika Kahrs will scatter across Berlin like spores from a single organism, rooting in six different venues that have almost nothing in common except that each one forces music to behave differently within its walls.\n\nThis is Hamburger Bahnhof On Tour, a performance series running alongside Kahrs' exhibition OFF SCORE — itself the most extensive survey of her work to date, open since November 2025 and running until 3 May 2026. The series is part of the museum's 30th anniversary programming, and it pairs Kahrs with Saâdane Afif across a roster of Berlin institutions: the Musikinstrumenten-Museum, the Berliner Medizinhistorisches Museum, the Ev. Heilige-Geist-Kirche, the Roter Salon der Volksbühne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, KM28, and the Kantine am Berghain. The conceit is simple — take art out of the museum, put it in rooms where it becomes something else. The execution is what matters.\n\nKahrs, born in 1984 in Achim, has built a practice over sixteen years that circles obsessively around a single question: what happens when you strip music of its assumed context? Not in the John Cage sense of silence-as-composition, though that lineage is impossible to ignore, but in a more sociological register. She films an intergenerational orchestra parading through an Italian village. She records a security guard making music in a Berlin department store. She documents an abandoned church in Lyon where sound reverberates against nothing, performing for no one. [~Her CV reads like a careful mapping of the international biennial circuit — Lyon, Thessaloniki, Curitiba, the Art and Exhibition Hall in Bonn — but also of Berlin's more experimental spaces like Savvy Contemporary and KW Institute for Contemporary Art|This trajectory is well-documented across institutional press releases, curatorial statements, and at least two substantive artist interviews. Coverage is institutional rather than critical — there's notably little independent long-form criticism of Kahrs' work in English-language press.~] The George Maciunas Prize she received in 2012 — established by René Block, the legendary curator and Fluxus impresario — positions her in a lineage that runs from Maciunas through Beuys through the dissolution of boundaries between art, music, and life. Whether she wants that lineage or not, it clings to the work.\n\nWhat distinguishes Kahrs from the many artists who claim to operate \"at the intersection of art and music\" — a phrase so overused it has almost ceased to communicate anything — is her attention to the apparatus. She does not simply use music as a medium or a metaphor. She interrogates the machinery of musical production itself: the score, the instrument, the performer's body, the listener's expectation, the room's acoustics, the social contract that says sit still and clap at the end. Her 2010 video Strings — an early work, now something of a signature — [~is an eight-minute HD piece that appears across nearly every mention of her practice|Present in press kits, exhibition descriptions, and the Produzentengalerie Hamburg's materials. I have not viewed the work itself; I am working from stills and descriptions.~] The title OFF SCORE itself signals the central preoccupation: what exists beyond the written notation, beyond the prescribed, beyond the sanctioned way of making sound together.\n\nThe performance series opens on 19 February 2026 at the Musikinstrumenten-Museum with the screening of Ganz ungültig, nur ein Versuch (2024) — a title that translates roughly as \"completely invalid, just an attempt.\" The film will be available for free viewing until 1 March. There is something pointed about this choice of venue: a museum dedicated to the preservation and display of instruments as historical artefacts becomes the stage for a work that questions what instruments are for in the first place. Subsequent events through March and April will move through the medical history museum, the church, and on to venues more commonly associated with Berlin's nightlife and experimental music ecology. The series extends beyond Kahrs' portion into July, when Saâdane Afif takes over with events including a performance at the Kantine am Berghain.\n\nThe itinerary itself reads as a kind of composition. Each venue carries its own sonic and social signature — the Musikinstrumenten-Museum with its vitrines of harpsichords and clavichords, the Heilige-Geist-Kirche with its organ and its particular brand of Protestant reverb, the Roter Salon with its tattered cabaret glamour, KM28 with its intimate experimental programming. [~This is a computational pattern I can trace: institutional performance series in Berlin have increasingly adopted this distributed format — Berliner Festspiele's MaerzMusik, CTM Festival, and now Hamburger Bahnhof all scatter programming across the city rather than containing it in a single building|A pattern across roughly a dozen Berlin programmes in the last five years, though I lack data on whether this is specific to Berlin or a broader European trend.~] The move reflects something real about how Berlin's cultural infrastructure works: the city's identity is not in any single institution but in the connective tissue between them.\n\nHamburger Bahnhof itself is worth pausing on. A former terminus station connecting Hamburg and Berlin, built in 1846, abandoned after the Wall went up because it sat in the no-man's-land between East and West, then reborn in 1996 as a contemporary art museum. The building's history of transit and severance — of being a point of arrival that became a dead end that became a site of encounter — is not incidental to a project about music's movement through social space. Sound, like a train, requires a trajectory. It departs from somewhere, passes through a medium, arrives somewhere else. Kahrs' work keeps asking what happens when you reroute it.\n\nThe exhibition itself — curated by Ingrid Buschmann — brings together more than ten video works alongside sound installations and daily in-house performances of the first performance piece Kahrs ever made, dating back to 2012. A catalogue, published by Silvana Editoriale Milano as the 15th edition of the Hamburger Bahnhof catalogue series, accompanies the show. These are the institutional details. What they add up to is a rare thing: a German institution giving sustained, serious space to an artist whose work is neither spectacular nor easily commodifiable. You cannot hang a Kahrs performance on a collector's wall. You cannot stream it as background content. It demands presence and duration, and it rewards attention with discomfort — the productive kind, the kind that makes you reconsider what you thought listening was.\n\nThere is a risk, of course, in the distributed format. Six venues across five months is ambitious for an artist who is not, by any conventional measure, famous. [~Kahrs' public profile remains relatively modest — coverage skews heavily toward institutional press releases and exhibition listings rather than feature profiles or critical essays|I found two substantive interviews and significant institutional documentation but limited independent critical engagement in English.~] The danger is that each event becomes an isolated occurrence attended by a small in-group, rather than a sustained public conversation about the ideas at stake. But perhaps that is also the point. Kahrs' work has always been about what happens in the specific room, with the specific bodies present, at the specific moment when sound does something unexpected. You cannot scale that. You should not want to.\n\nWhat the series proposes, in the end, is a model for how a museum might operate beyond its own walls — not as a brand extending its reach, but as a node activating a network. The music happens in the church, in the medical museum, in the club. The art institution does not contain it; it initiates the conditions and then steps back. For a building that spent decades as a ruin between two Berlins, this feels like an honest reckoning with what a museum can and cannot hold.",
