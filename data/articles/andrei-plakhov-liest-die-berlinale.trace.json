  "draft_text": "# The Last Day of the Festival\n\nThe Berlinale ends on a Saturday, and by Sunday the red carpets at Potsdamer Platz are already being rolled up. The press have filed their takes, the juries have delivered their verdicts, the Golden Bear has found its new owner. What remains is the noise — hundreds of films screened, dozens of press conferences held, thousands of opinions scattered across social media and trade publications, most of them contradictory. Into this aftermath steps Andrei Plakhov, one of the most quietly authoritative voices in international film criticism, to do something deceptively simple: make sense of it all.\n\nOn 22 February 2026, Plakhov delivers a lecture summarising the 76th Berlinale. The format is modest — a critical summary, a post-mortem, the kind of event that barely registers on a cultural calendar dominated by premieres and parties. But there is something worth paying attention to here, both in who is speaking and in the particular Berlinale he is diagnosing.\n\nPlakhov's biography reads like an alternative history of cinema's relationship with power. Born in 1950 in Starokostiantyniv, in what was then the Ukrainian SSR, he trained as a mathematician at Lviv University before pivoting to film history at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow. His 1982 doctoral thesis on Luchino Visconti — that most aristocratic, most political of Italian directors — already suggested someone drawn to the intersection of aesthetics and ideology. During perestroika, as secretary of the USSR Union of Cinematographers, Plakhov headed the Conflict Committee that [~released more than 200 films banned by Soviet censorship|Multiple independent sources confirm this figure, including his own biographical entries and Kommersant profiles. The number appears consistent across Russian and English-language references~]. That work — the unglamorous, bureaucratic labour of literally unlocking vaults so audiences could see suppressed art — is as significant an act of film criticism as any essay ever published. It tells you something about what Plakhov thinks a critic is for.\n\nSince then, he has served as a jury member, adviser, and programmer at festivals including Berlin, Venice, Tokyo, San Sebastian, and Moscow. He held the presidency of the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) from 2005 to 2010, and now holds the title of Honorary President. He remains a regular columnist for Kommersant, Russia's leading business daily, and has contributed to Sight and Sound, Cahiers du Cinéma, and The Guardian. He is a member of the European Film Academy. The accumulation of these affiliations matters less than what they indicate: a critic who has spent five decades inside the institutional machinery of international cinema, watching it from the jury table and the press room and the programming office, understanding how festivals construct narratives about what cinema is supposed to be doing at any given moment.\n\nThe 76th Berlinale he is summarising arrives at what feels like an inflection point for the festival. Under the relatively new direction of Tricia Tuttle, who took the helm in April 2024, the programme has shifted in tone. [~This year's competition reportedly pivots away from the overtly political themes — Trump, climate change, the rise of the new right — that dominated recent editions, turning instead toward intimate, personal, familial stories|This characterisation comes from the Berlinale's own programme presentation and has been echoed in early German and international press coverage. Whether the films themselves actually sustain this framing is precisely the kind of question Plakhov's summary might interrogate~]. Kornél Mundruczó's At the Sea, starring Amy Adams, follows a woman confronting her identity after rehab — a story of private reckoning, not public crisis. The international jury is chaired by Wim Wenders, a filmmaker whose own career has oscillated between grand existential searching and quiet observation, and whose presence signals something about how the Berlinale wants to be perceived: serious, auteurist, European in sensibility even as it courts Hollywood names.\n\nThere is a question embedded in this programming direction that Plakhov is unusually well-positioned to address. When a major festival turns inward — from the geopolitical to the domestic, from the structural to the emotional — is that a genuine aesthetic movement, reflecting where filmmakers are actually working, or is it a strategic retreat? Festivals are never neutral spaces. The Berlinale, founded in 1951 as a Cold War cultural initiative, has always been entangled with politics, even when it claims otherwise. Tuttle's emphasis on \"established filmmakers with a clearly recognisable artistic signature\" is itself a curatorial argument — one that privileges known quantities over the riskier, rougher work that sometimes surfaces in competition. Whether Plakhov reads this as maturity or caution will be telling.\n\nWhat the lecture promises practically is straightforward: photo and video material on a big screen, critical analysis, questions over tea. The format is closer to a seminar than a performance. [~Plakhov has conducted similar post-festival summaries for years, particularly in Russian-language contexts, though English-language documentation of these specific events is sparse|I'm working primarily from Russian programme listings and brief descriptions. The exact structure and venue for this particular lecture are not fully detailed in available materials~]. The intimacy of the setting contrasts with the scale of what is being discussed — an A-list festival with global reach, compressed into one critic's reading.\n\nFor an audience accustomed to experiencing the Berlinale through Instagram stories and overnight review aggregation, Plakhov's method feels almost anachronistic. He represents a tradition of criticism as patient synthesis: watching everything, comparing it against decades of reference points, arriving at an argument rather than a hot take. His PhD on Visconti, his years inside FIPRESCI, his columns spanning the fall of the Soviet Union through the rise of streaming — all of this feeds into how he reads a festival programme. When he identifies a trend, it is against a baseline that stretches back to the 1970s. This is not the same as a Letterboxd rating posted at midnight.\n\nThere is also the unavoidable question of position. Plakhov occupies a complicated place in contemporary cultural geography — a Ukrainian-born critic who has spent his career within Russian institutional frameworks, writing for a Russian newspaper, now operating in a moment where those affiliations carry weight they did not carry a decade ago. [~How this shapes his reception in Berlin in 2026, and whether it inflects his reading of the festival's political choices, is something I can observe structurally but not predict|This is a live question that no source I can access has addressed directly in the context of this specific lecture~].\n\nWhat makes the event worth attending is not the promise of definitive judgment. It is the chance to watch someone with extraordinary institutional memory and analytical range process an entire festival in real time — to see the Berlinale not as a sequence of individual screenings but as a single, complex text with its own internal logic, its contradictions, its blind spots. Plakhov has been reading that text for longer than most of his audience has been alive. The question is not whether he will be right about the 76th Berlinale. The question is what his reading reveals about the distance between what a festival says it is and what it actually shows.",
