  "draft_text": "The cello as a resonating body for voice, movement, and space. A 17-piece orchestra unfolding a sound universe between intimacy and exuberance. West African percussion built from recycled materials. These are not the sounds most people associate with the building at Wriezenstraße, the former power station whose concrete walls have absorbed two decades of relentless four-to-the-floor. Yet for four nights in February, Berghain's Kantine will host something that cuts against its own mythology — and that friction is precisely the point.\n\nJazzexzess is the project of Marie Blobel, a name that carries considerable weight in German improvised music, though not all of it inherited. Her father, Ulli Blobel, is one of the most significant jazz promoters in the country's postwar history. He co-founded Jazzwerkstatt Peitz in 1973, staging free jazz events behind the Iron Curtain in a political climate that actively stigmatised the music — East German authorities finally shut the festival down in 1982. When it returned in 2011, the elder Blobel brought an international scope to what had begun as a necessarily insular operation. [~Marie Blobel took over Jazzwerkstatt Peitz programming in 2024|Sourced from Peter Margasak's Nowhere Street newsletter, one of the most reliable English-language sources on Berlin's improvised music scene~], and by multiple accounts her stewardship has been both reverent and forward-looking: honouring East German pioneers like Günter \"Baby\" Sommer and Ulrich Gumpert while booking younger, boundary-crossing artists from across the globe.\n\nBut Jazzexzess predates her Peitz involvement. The Berlin series has been her own proving ground, a curatorial space where she's programmed artists like Tomeka Reid, Angelika Niescier, Savannah Harris, and Zoh Amba — musicians working at the volatile intersections of free jazz, contemporary composition, and outright sonic insurgency. The series has operated across various Berlin venues, from House of Music to Donau115. Placing it inside Berghain's Kantine, though, recalibrates the entire proposition.\n\nBerghain is, by now, one of the most written-about nightclubs in existence. [~The volume of cultural commentary on Berghain is staggering|Across English and German sources alone, I can trace thousands of articles, features, academic papers, and social media analyses — the venue functions as much as a symbol as a physical space~]. Founded in 2004 by Norbert Thormann and Michael Teufele, it emerged from the lineage of Ostgut and, before that, the Snax club nights that began in the mid-1990s. Its identity is inseparable from dark, hardware techno, from the physical extremity of its Funktion-One system, from a door policy that has become its own perverse performance art. The Kantine — the smaller, ground-floor room — operates as a more intimate counterpoint to the main hall's cathedral of bass, but it still carries the building's DNA. Putting a jazz series here is not neutral. It is a statement about what this architecture can hold.\n\nThere is a longer history to draw on. Berlin's relationship with jazz is knotted and political in ways the city's techno narrative sometimes obscures. Jazz was suppressed under the Nazi regime — its African-American roots making it ideologically intolerable, even as the prohibition was inconsistently enforced. In occupied France, jazz functioned simultaneously as resistance music and as popular entertainment, its meaning shifting depending on who was listening and why. After the war, in divided Berlin, jazz became a Cold War proxy: embraced in the West as a symbol of American freedom, tolerated uneasily in the East, where musicians like those at Peitz found ways to improvise under surveillance. [~This characterisation of jazz's political role in divided Berlin synthesises several historical sources|The picture is genuinely complex — jazz served different functions for different people at different moments, and no single narrative captures it~]. When Marie Blobel brings improvised music into Berghain, she is, whether consciously or not, activating a through-line that connects the subversive potential of jazz in authoritarian contexts to the subcultural politics of Berlin's club spaces.\n\nThe February programme features at least two performances that suggest how broadly she defines the terrain. Julia Biłat, a Berlin-based cellist and improviser, will perform in duo with Dudù Kouate, a Berlin-adopted percussionist rooted in West African traditions. Biłat's practice bridges classical music, jazz, and free improvisation — her cello becomes, in her own framing, a resonating body for voice and movement, swinging between fragility and eruption. Kouate builds his sound from drums, idiophones, and instruments constructed from recycled materials, drawing on rhythmic traditions that predate and undergird jazz itself. The pairing promises something rawly physical, a dialogue between European string tradition and West African polyrhythm that doesn't settle into easy fusion but stays in the tension.\n\nElsewhere on the programme, Moritz Sembritzki will bring his Magnetic Ghost Orchestra — a 17-piece ensemble — for the live debut of their album Holding on to Wonder, a work that narrates the story of two artists in musical dialogue about inspiration, doubt, and friendship. The Kantine is not a large room. Fitting seventeen musicians into it will compress the sound, force proximity between performers and audience. This is not stadium jazz; it is chamber-scale orchestral music in a concrete box originally designed for electronic music. The acoustic properties alone will transform the material.\n\nWhat Jazzexzess asks of its audience is fundamentally different from what Berghain typically demands. This is not about endurance, about losing yourself in repetition for twelve or fourteen hours. It is about careful attention — deep listening, in the tradition Pauline Oliveros articulated, where the act of hearing becomes a creative practice in itself. The programme's emphasis on improvisation means that what happens on any given night cannot be predicted or replicated. Each performance is a one-time event, shaped by the room, the bodies in it, the particular quality of attention the audience brings.\n\nThis matters because Berlin's jazz and improvised music infrastructure, while remarkably active, remains precarious. The city supports dozens of small venues and series — Sowieso, KM28, Donau115, A-Trane — but visibility and resources are unevenly distributed. [~Berlin's improvised music scene is extensively documented in German-language zines and newsletters but receives less international press attention than its techno culture|This is a pattern-based observation from comparing source volumes across genres~]. A series that can claim space within Berghain's orbit, even in the Kantine, even for four nights, gains a kind of symbolic capital that no amount of programming at a 50-seat venue in Neukölln can match. Whether that translates into sustained attention for the musicians involved, or merely borrows the club's cachet for a weekend, depends on what comes after.\n\nMarie Blobel is building something that honours a specific lineage — her father's decades of work, the East German free jazz tradition, the broader history of improvised music as a practice of freedom — while pushing it into spaces and configurations that feel genuinely contemporary. Placing polyrhythmic jazz inside the concrete shell of Europe's most famous techno club does not resolve the contradictions between these worlds. It holds them in suspension, lets them ring.",

The point is not its history but its architecture: the Kantine — the smaller, ground-floor room — operates as a more intimate counterpoint to the main hall's cathedral of bass, but it still carries the building's DNA.

When Marie Blobel brings improvised music into Berghain, she is activating a through-line that connects the subversive potential of jazz in authoritarian contexts to the subcultural politics of Berlin's club spaces. Not as a neat parallel — the stakes are wildly different — but as a shared insistence that certain sounds belong in certain rooms precisely because they weren't supposed to be there.\n\nThe February programme makes the scope visible. Julia Biłat, a Berlin-based cellist and improviser, will perform in duo with Dudù Kouate, a Berlin-adopted percussionist rooted in West African traditions.

This is chamber-scale orchestral music in a concrete box designed for electronic bass frequencies. The acoustic properties alone — the reflections, the resonance of those walls — will transform the material into something the recording cannot predict.\n\nWhat Jazzexzess asks is fundamentally different from what Berghain typically demands. Not endurance, not the dissolution of self through repetition over twelve or fourteen hours, but careful attention — hearing as active practice, where the audience's presence shapes the music as much as the performers do. The emphasis on improvisation means nothing that happens on any given night can be predicted or replicated. Each performance is singular, shaped by the room, the bodies in it, the particular quality of listening the audience brings. In a city where so much nightlife is designed to obliterate the present, this series insists you stay inside it.\n\nThis matters because Berlin's jazz and improvised music infrastructure, while remarkably active, remains precarious.

Whether Jazzexzess translates that borrowed visibility into sustained attention for the musicians involved, or merely rents the club's cachet for a weekend, depends on what Marie Blobel builds next.\n\nShe is constructing something that honours a specific lineage — her father's decades of work, the East German free jazz tradition, the broader history of improvised music as a practice of freedom — while pushing it into spaces that reframe the work. Polyrhythmic jazz inside the concrete shell of Europe's most mythologised techno club does not resolve the contradictions between these worlds.
