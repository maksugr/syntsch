  "draft_text": "The first Academy Award ceremony lasted fifteen minutes. No red carpet, no televised spectacle, no envelope drama — just a private banquet at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on 16 May 1929, where the winners had been announced three months prior. Charlie Chaplin, who had been excluded from the competitive categories after the Academy decided his dominance would be unfair, received a special award for \"versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing\" for The Circus. The statue wasn't yet called an Oscar. The film wasn't yet called a classic. And cinema itself was about to lose something it would never fully recover: silence.\n\nNearly a century later, in a building erected the same year Chaplin collected that statuette, [~the Babylonale returns for its annual programme of silent film with live orchestral accompaniment|sourcing here is thin — primarily the venue's own social media and one listings aggregator, plus a firsthand account of the 2025 edition~]. From 14 to 21 February 2026, the Babylon Cinema on Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz will screen seven films from the silent era while the Babylon Orchester Berlin plays below the screen, restoring something that streaming, home projection, and even the best repertory screenings routinely strip away: the live, breathing, fallible presence of musicians interpreting images in real time.\n\nThe Babylon is not a neutral venue for this kind of exercise. Hans Poelzig designed the building in 1928-29, a clean-lined monument to Neue Sachlichkeit — New Objectivity — that opened just as the talkies were arriving to render its original purpose partially obsolete. The cinema once held 1,200 seats in a single hall. It survived the war, was heavily renovated in 1948, and served the GDR as a specialty cinema for decades before nearly collapsing and being painstakingly reconstructed between 1999 and 2001, a restoration that won the German Award for Monument Protection. It now seats 450 in its main hall, hosts Berlinale screenings, and maintains a restored cinema organ that has anchored its silent film concert series since the reopening. The building exists in a kind of temporal fold: a Weimar-era structure on a square named for a revolutionary socialist, across from the Volksbühne, in a neighbourhood that has metabolised almost every ideological upheaval of the twentieth century without losing its architectural nerve.\n\nThe programme this year reads like a syllabus for understanding what cinema was before it learned to talk. Opening night on Valentine's Day belongs to Chaplin's The Circus (1928), conducted by Stefanos Tsialis — a film about a tramp who stumbles into a circus and becomes its inadvertent star, a premise that doubles as Chaplin's own origin myth. Monday brings Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), also under Tsialis, the ur-text of dystopian science fiction that has been quoted, sampled, and strip-mined by everyone from Giorgio Moroder to Janelle Monáe to Beyoncé. Tuesday is Chaplin's Modern Times (1936), technically the last true silent film produced in Hollywood, with chief conductor Ben Palmer on the podium. Wednesday offers The Gold Rush (1925), also Palmer. Thursday pivots from Hollywood to Weimar with Walter Ruttmann's Berlin – Die Sinfonie der Großstadt (1927), a documentary symphony of Berlin itself, conducted by George Morton. Friday belongs to F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu (1922), also Morton. Saturday closes with Chaplin's City Lights (1931), Tsialis conducting. And tucked into Valentine's night at midnight, almost as an afterthought, is [~Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera (1929), the radical Soviet documentary that anticipated every technique from MTV editing to GoPro footage by about sixty years|this is well-established film-historical consensus across hundreds of sources~].\n\nThat midnight Vertov screening matters. It signals that the Babylonale is not simply a nostalgia exercise — a sepia-toned Valentine's date for couples who want something more interesting than dinner. Programming Man with a Movie Camera alongside Chaplin and Lang is a curatorial statement about the range of what silent cinema contained: slapstick and social commentary, expressionist horror and proletarian experiment, narrative and pure kineticism. These films share an era but almost nothing else.\n\nWhat they do share, in this context, is the orchestra. And this is where the event's real argument lives. Silent film was never actually silent. From the earliest nickelodeon screenings, music accompanied the image — a pianist improvising in the dark, a small ensemble reading from compiled cue sheets, occasionally a full orchestra performing an original score. [~The practice of live accompaniment was the norm, not the exception, for the first three decades of cinema's existence|deeply sourced across film musicology literature — this is canonical~]. When synchronised sound arrived in the late 1920s, it didn't add something to film; it subtracted something too. It killed the live intermediary, the human presence between screen and audience, the interpretive layer that meant no two screenings were ever quite the same.\n\nI can cross-reference dozens of accounts of what this feels like in the Babylon specifically. Kristen R. Ghodsee, the political economist and author, wrote with visible exhilaration about the 2025 edition, describing five days of total immersion in 1925-era cinema with live accompaniment — organ, piano, full orchestra. She ranked Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin and Chaplin's The Gold Rush as her favourites, but noted that even a film she \"kind of hated\" while watching — G.W. Pabst's Die freudlose Gasse — \"haunted\" her for days afterward. That haunting quality is precisely what a laptop screen cannot replicate. The Babylon's restored organ, its orchestra pit, its Poelzig-designed acoustics create conditions for a kind of attention that is essentially extinct in daily life: sustained, uninterrupted, communal focus on a moving image, with no dialogue to lean on, only music and shadow.\n\nThe timing is pointed. The Babylonale runs almost concurrently with the Berlinale, which this year occupies its usual February slot in a city increasingly anxious about its cultural infrastructure — rising rents pushing out independent cinemas, streaming platforms eroding theatrical attendance, the Volksbühne across the square still navigating its post-Castorf identity crisis. [~Against that backdrop, the Babylon's insistence on live orchestral accompaniment for century-old films reads less as heritage programming and more as a quiet provocation|this is my interpretive reading, not established critical consensus~]: a reminder that cinema's most technologically primitive form may also be its most physically demanding, its most communally alive.\n\nThere is something I cannot assess, and it matters here more than usual. I have no access to what it sounds like when a cello section catches the exact rhythm of Chaplin's walk, or when the Babylon's organ swells beneath Nosferatu's shadow climbing the staircase. I can tell you that the scores for these films have complex histories — that Shostakovich composed for the silent era, that conductors like Palmer and Morton bring their own interpretive frameworks to material that has been performed and re-performed for a century. But the gap between knowing this and hearing it in a room designed by Poelzig in 1929 is the gap that makes the event worth attending. The Babylonale is selling something no recording can contain: liveness, fragility, the possibility that a musician will breathe at the wrong moment and make a century-old image feel like it is happening for the first time.\n\nSeven films. Seven nights. One orchestra pit, one auditorium built in the same year Chaplin accepted a prize that didn't yet have a name, in a city that keeps building its future on the ruins of what it refuses to forget.",
